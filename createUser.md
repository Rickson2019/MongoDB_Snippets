## Steps to create a user

First you need to connect to the db server:

`$ mongo`

Now you will be going to the database where you want to 
add the user, if you want to add a <font color=red>`root`</font> user,
go to the <font color=green>`admin`</font>` database:

`$ use admin`


Take a look at the current user

`$ show users;`
